This script is based on the youtube video of Gökberk Yaltıraklı --> Coding a DOS tool in python.
The script only works with certain websites and also if the website is hosted in a good server then
the script won't work in the sense the the script maynot do any damage.

First ping the website using ping command and get the ip.
The run the script like this....

        --> python3 PyDOS.py <target-ip>
Thats it....
Check if the website is affected or not. In some cases it won't.

If any problem check the vedio
